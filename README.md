In this project, I have worked with a company's email network where each node corresponds to a person at the company, and each edge indicates that at least one email has been sent between two people.
The network also contains the node attributes Department and ManagementSalary.
Department indicates the department in the company which the person belongs to, and ManagementSalary indicates whether that person is receiving a management position salary.
I have predicted future connections between employees of the network. The future connections information has been loaded into the variable future_connections. The index is a tuple indicating a pair of nodes that currently do not have a connection, and the Future Connection column indicates if an edge between those two nodes will exist in the future, where a value of 1.0 indicates a future connection.
To accomplish this, I have created a matrix of features for the edges found in future_connections using networkx, trained a Logistic Regression classifier on those edges in future_connections that have Future Connection data, and predict a probability of the edge being a future connection for those edges in future_connections where Future Connection is missing.
I have returned predictions as the probability of the corresponding edge being a future connection.
